# Contributing
We follow the general principles of contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) as described here:
https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/

This is the onset of a project, so the guidelines should grow if there is a need to.

## I just have a question
File an issue with the label `question`. It is noteworthy that we will solve issues in a best
effort manner. 

## Creating issues
Please follow the bug or feature templates in the issues. 

## Coding conventions
### Commits
Try to be polite as Uncle Bob would say. Write polite git commits and refer issues if possible.

### Code
We follow rather standard Typescript and React coding conventions. We specified EsLint rules and
those should be followed. Large refactorings should always be proposed first via an issue.
